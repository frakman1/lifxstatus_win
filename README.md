- You may need to make your own icons (busy.png, available.png etc) because your taskbar background might be a different colour.
- Ensure that your Skype app icon is ALWAYS displayed on your taskbar and not tucked away/hidden. The script relies on the icon being visible on the screen.
- This will not work remotely over RDP for instance.
